## Our meetinghouse is open to all.

Please come and join us! Our [about page](/about) has more information about Quaker worship. 

### Meeting in nature

Some members also choose to worship in nature. Friends who prefer meet on our property at the end our long driveway. Same time as our regular meeting 11 A.M. Sunday (First day).
