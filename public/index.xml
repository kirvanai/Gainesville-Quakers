      <description>Quaker meetings are open to all. If you would like to join us and share in our stillness you would be most welcome. Children, too, are welcome.&#xA;The heart of the Quaker way is the silent meeting for worship. We seek a communal gathered stillness, where we can be open to inspiration from the Spirit of God. In our meetings we find both peace of mind and challenging insights, deep community and a renewed sense of individual purpose.</description>
